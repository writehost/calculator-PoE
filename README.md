Hello everyone, my name is Nick Sukhotsky, I made a calculator for my own purposes, I work as a system administrator, so I often write simple programs to suit my needs, and here is a PoE calculator in which you can roughly calculate which power supply to install for the length of the cable, the cable is twisted pair in my cable standardization had a maximum permissible power of 15 amperes, so it works fully functionally up to 15 amperes 48 volts, but calculations can also be done at other voltages. There is a PoE calculator as well as calculators: a simple subnet calculator, an Internet speed calculator (it also works abstractly) and a built-in password generator. In general, the program has room for improvement, for example, a save button could be attached to the password generator so that passwords could be saved in a separate file or even in some kind of database. You can add a choice of cable standardizations to the PoE calculator, but even then the calculation formulas will be different. It would be possible to add a function to the calculation of Internet speed that would take into account the balance of the network load; in general, I will finalize it in the process and also look forward to your wishes! Thank you for your attention!
